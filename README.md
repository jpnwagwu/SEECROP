# Image_classifier

Hi welcome to my Cassava Leaf Diseases classification project

I have modeled the image data on a deep neural network for cassava leaf diseases classification

---------------------------------------------------------------------
MOTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viral diseases are major sources of poor yields for cassava- the second largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa. At least 80% of small scale farmers grow this starchy root because it can withstand harsh conditions.  The common method of viral diseases detection is to visually inspect and diagnose each and every plant which is labor intensive, slow and expensive. With the help of data science, it may be possible to identify common diseases so they can be treated. Each cassava image will be classified into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. With this, farmers may be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage.
In this project, we will use a dataset of 21,367 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda in the train set and another 15000 images in the test set. Most images were crowd sourced from farmers taking photos of their gardens, and annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala. This is in a format that most realistically represents what farmers would need to diagnose in real life.
